        <h3><em>A way of life</em></h3>
  <!-- Free form sloth poetry -->
 <p>
    In this hectic world we live in with all of its troubles, <br>
    which our devices reminds us of frequently on a daily basis, <br>
    it might be a good idea to look towards the most chillest of mammals, <br>
    a mammal so chill and slow moving, algae grows on it. <br>
    Ever heard of a Sloth with burnout? Didn't think so.<br>

    <h2>The Holy Trinity</h2>
    <p>
        The three most powerful species of sloths in order of most to least chill are as follows.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>The Pygmy Sloths</li>
        <li>Maned Sloths</li>
        <li>Pale-throated Sloths</li>
    </ol>

        <h3>What makes the difference</h3>
    <p>
        It could be argued that all the species of sloths have an equal amount of chill <br> 
        but through extensive research and interviews it has been confirmed that <br> 
        there's a direct correlation between a higher level of stress hormones and species of sloths <br>
        who appear in the lists of critically endangered animals. <br>
        Nr.3 on our list is considered almost extinct, therefore pretty stressed and drained of chill.
